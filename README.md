# fcc-wiki-viewer
This project is part of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum for learning Javascript and APIs.

# learning curve
I really got hung up on using Wikipedia's API. Their description page seemed utterly useless, so I had to venture out and find other ways to understand using the API without stumbling across the answer. I wanted to figure it out, but I just needed a little information (how to use the URL to make the right API request) in order to run with it and do it on my own.
Once I figured out the right URL parameters, the rest was easy.

# favorite part
Injecting the API's content into the HTML is really cool. I love for loops like nobody's business. Also, working on the UX was really enjoyable. I wanted the user to be able to begin typing the moment the page loaded (autofocus) and be able to click enter to search (I had to add Javascript to work around Bootstrap's input group HTML syntax). 

# one thing left
The only thing I need to do to wrap up this project is make the search more mobile-friendly, as I just realized Bootstrap doesn't help me there with the inline search/buttons.
